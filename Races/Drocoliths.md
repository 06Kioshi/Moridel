# Dracoliths

**Physical Appearance:**
- Dracoliths have a hierarchy based on how "Dragon-like" they appear. The more dragon traites they have, the closer they are to royalty. (Eg: Dragon-like face, scaly skin, horns and a tail would make you a sort of prince. Having just horns and a tail you'd be an average joe.)

**Natural Traits:**
- Draconic Roar - They can emit a resonating roar that temporarily disrupts and manipulates the energy flows around them. This roar can cause fluctuations in nearby sources of energy, such as disrupting magical spells, negating technological systems, or overwhelming opponents' focus.

**Lore:**
